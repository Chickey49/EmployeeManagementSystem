## About the Project  
A solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.  In this application, I used callbacks extensively.  The inquirer module would return user choices which were turned into JS classes.  I would insert these into the database with CRUD methods.  I also gained much experience with SQL joins to combine data tables together in a single result. I also learned about local vs remote database hosting and managing multiple environment variables.
## Usage  
To use, open the command line, navigate to the directory, npm i, then run node js/app.js.
